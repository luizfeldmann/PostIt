Sticky notes for windows desktop

This is intended as an alternative to the "Sticky Notes" app that comes with Windows, which has the major drawback of taking space in the taskbar.

## Features
* Minimalist design
* Uses the tray instead of the taskbar
* Notes actually stick to the desktop
* Allows moving/resizing the posts
* Allows changing text's font, color and background
* Styles apply to each post individually
* Lightweight (written in pure C with Win32 API)
* Portable

## Build
Use the Code::Blocks project (.cbp) or just download the binary I left in *bin/Debug/*

## Installing
* Copy the executable wherever you like e.g. *Program Files*
* Place a shortcut to the program in *C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup* so it will open when you start your PC

## Screenshots
You can customize your posts:
